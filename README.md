# Cordova Laboratory

> Caution: Safety Goggles are Recommended!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is for experimental code. Examples include demo apps,
native api explorations, or anything really that does not fit in an existing Cordova platform.

## Project Organization

> Everyone works on a branch

`master` branch should *never* have content.

Each project should create a separate branch to work on. There are major benefits
to this practice:

- Each project has an isolate git history, which allows for easy migration to
  a new git repository;
- Working directory is not polluted with the files of other projects.
- Projects will not step on each others toes.
